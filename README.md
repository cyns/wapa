# Script-Based Web Accessibility
### Abstract
This is a proposal for a set of User Intention Events that build on ARIA to extend accessibility functionality to complex, scripted web applications. It supports use cases where markup-based solutions have proven impossible, difficult or costly to implement.


# Introduction

This proposal is being made to start discussion in the Web Incubation Community Group to start discussion, with the expectation there will be changes as it is combined with similar proposals.

## Background and Rationale

This proposal is based on [WAPA](https://github.com/cyns/wapa/blob/master/wapa.html) and got further inspiration from [Indie UI Events](https://w3c.github.io/indie-ui/indie-ui-events.html) and [Mozilla Web Accessibility API](https://asurkov.github.io/a11yapi/)
